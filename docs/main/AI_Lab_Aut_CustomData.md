# Mission 3: Configure Fulfilment Action and create an order.

Custom data feature is now available for autonomous AI agents. This feature enhances the end-user experience and provides you with greater control over voice conversations. With this feature, developers can send a JSON payload from the WXCC flow directly to the autonomous AI agent at the start of each session. You can use this payload to customize agent behavior for each customer or to pass information from the flow that the agent needs.

The custom data sent to the AI Agent can be accessed in the agent's goals, instructions, welcome message, actions, or slots using the syntax {{variable}} in the Webex AI Agent studio application.



## Mission overview
Your mission is to:

Customize the Welcome message by sending custom data from the Voice flow to AI Agent.

### Task 2. Configure AI Agent with the custom data from the Voice Flow. 

1. Open up your AI Agent **<copy><w class="attendee"></w>_2000_AutoAI_Lab</copy>**.

2. In the **Welcome message** replace "there" with **<copy>{{customer_name}}</copy>**. In this case we expect that the caller will hear: Hi **dear customer**, my name is Blossom, the AI Agent. How can I assist you?

4. Place the test call to the number that is associated with your Channel **<copy><w class="attendee"></w>_2000_Channel</copy>**, and check if you hear the custom message.

5. Confirm the expected behavior by reviewing the Session transcripts.
