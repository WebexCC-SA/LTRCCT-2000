## Learning Objectives

### Know before you start

1. We will be using a shared lab tenant for simulations, meaning all attendees will work within the same Webex Contact Center environment. To avoid conflicts, ensure that any entities you configure are tagged with the Attendee ID assigned to you.
2. The majority of the configuration in Control Hub is already set up, allowing you to focus primarily on configuration of **Webex AI Agent** and other AI features. Of course, there may still be some elements to adjust, but these should be minimal, letting you concentrate on building and refining the flow logic rather than spending time on initial setup.
3. The Human Agent has been configured for you. You will be performing the rest of the configuration for the AI Agent and the integration with the channels.
4. Please ask for help when you need it. You can do so by:<br>
   a. Dropping your question in the LAB Space **LTRCCT-2000 Hands-On AI in Action** from Webex App in your Lab PC. </br>
   b. Raising your hand and calling the proctor.<br>
