### Task 2. Evaluate agent using the Evaluation form.  

1. Go back to your non-incognito browser and check if your agent is still logged in. You might still be logged in after completing the AI Assistant lab. If not, please login to your agent desktop using your admin account.

2. Place a test call to the number that is associated with your channel **<copy><w class="attendee"></w>_2000_Voice_Queue</copy>** and ask to talk to the human agent. During the conversation, ask the caller's name but don't ask what the occasion of the flowers is.
