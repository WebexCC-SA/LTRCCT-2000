## Story

Topic Analytics in Webex Contact Center (WxCC) serves to analyze and uncover the main reasons why customers contact the center by reviewing thousands of customer conversations. It uses AI to highlight the most common customer inquiry topics and organizes them into a manageable, prioritized list of topics.

For example, in a flower shop scenario, the administrator can review these topics to understand frequent customer requests or issues. Based on this insight, the administrator can implement AI agents specifically designed to handle those requests autonomously.
