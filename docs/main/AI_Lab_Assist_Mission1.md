## Feature Description

AI Agent Transfer Summary enhances agent efficiency and elevate customer experiences.

When a customer calls the contact center and interacts with an AI Agent, they may request to speak with a live human agent at some point during the conversation. Once connected to an agent, it is important for the agent to receive a concise summary of the customer's interaction with the AI Agent. This summary provides the agent with a quick overview of the customer's call reason. The **AI Agent Handoff Summary** feature provides this summary, displaying it on the agent's desktop within the AI-Assistant Widget.

## Mission Details

Your mission is to:

1. Configure a smooth handoff to live human agent from AI Agent.
2. Create a summary of Virtual Agent transcript to be provided during handoff.
3. Use AI Assistant widget as an Agent.

### (Read Only) Task 1 . Order Provisioning & Control Hub Settings

1. You should have the new AI Assistant SKU **A-FLEX-AI-ASST** from CCW provisioned in the tenant.

2. Once you have provisioned it, admins with the appropriate profile and access controls will be able to see the AI Assistant menu in Control Hub. From there, the customer can enable/disable the **Virtual Agent Transfer Summary** feature from the Control Hub.

   (**Note: Default desktop layout already incudes the AI Agent Assistance widget**). <br/>
