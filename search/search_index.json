The lab content will be available to you even after your pod is no longer available. </p> <p>In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with Webex Contact Center's advanced AI solutions. This lab is designed to help you understand the Cisco Text-to-Speech engine and explore the capabilities of the Webex AI Agent, which utilizes built-in and proprietary models as well as natural language processing (NLP). You'll learn how to seamlessly escalate conversations from an AI agent to a human agent, ensuring efficient and intelligent customer interactions. </p> <p>In addition, we will cover several exciting AI-driven features such as Agent Wellness, which supports the well-being of agents during interactions, and Call Drop Summary, a feature that captures and summarizes previous dropped calls. These innovations demonstrate the power of AI in enhancing both customer and agent experiences. </p> <p>To further enhance your learning, we have included bonus lab content. This will allow you to familiarize yourself with our Supervisor Desktop, future enhancements to streamline Agent and Supervisor sign-in, and future AI Agent capabilities. </p> <p>Let\u2019s dive in and explore how Webex AI is shaping the future of customer service and agent support. </p>"},{"location":"advanced/Lab1/#disclaimer","title":"Disclaimer","text":"<p>Although the lab design and configuration examples could be used as a reference, for design related questions please contact your representative at Cisco, or a Cisco partner.</p>"},{"location":"graphics/Lab1/dummy/","title":"Dummy","text":""},{"location":"graphics/Lab2/dummy/","title":"Dummy","text":""},{"location":"graphics/download/1/","title":"1","text":""},{"location":"graphics/overview/dummy/","title":"Dummy","text":""},{"location":"graphics/temp/dummy/","title":"Dummy","text":""},{"location":"howToUse/admonition/","title":"Admonition","text":"<p>In addition to the  stock admonitions which are available out of the box we have added some additional branded admonitions which were created by Bobby McGonigle. </p> <p>Blank</p> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
